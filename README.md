# SIC-XE-Assembler
A simple implementation of SIC/XE assembler, written in python.

# Overview 
Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC) is a hypothetical computer that includes the
hardware features most often found on real machines. 

There are two versions of SIC,
1. SIC standard Model
2. SIC/XE (extra equipment or expensive)

In this repository, I implement the assembler of the latter.
